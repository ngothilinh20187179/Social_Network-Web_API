# Social Network API
## 🎯 Overview
This is a project focused on building the database and core Web APIs that mimic the essential functionalities of a social networking application.
- Database: To create the necessary data structure and schema for storing core information, including user data, messages, friend lists, and other elements typical of a real-world social media application.
- API: To develop robust Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that enable client-side applications (Web or Mobile) to interact with the database. These APIs cover crucial functions such as user login/authentication, friend management, messaging, and more.
